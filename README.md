### Description
A Front-end application deployed to heroku to meet a full-stack challenge which allows the user to view a range of produce sold by different farmers so their clients are able to buy it straight away. 

### How to Install
To view the program in action click here [!FreshVeg](https://afternoon-waters-14450.herokuapp.com/)

### Instructions
Simply click on the desired produce you wish to see which then leads you to a range of farmers which sell the produce and select the produce you wish to buy and the amount will display.  Unfortunately to a limited time scope our team was unable to add in anymore than this.  It was planned in upcoming features to turn it into a webstore like thing.  

### Usage
The program can only be run from the CLI.  With limited data manipulation.  More options will be updated as required or requested.
