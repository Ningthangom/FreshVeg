### Description
Our application was developed on the concept to meet a community need of being able to for farmers to sell their produce directly to their clients.  What we created felt like we met that need.  

An application deployed to heroku to meet a full-stack project requirements.  Which included allowing the user to make a post request to view a range of produce sold by different farmers so their clients are able to buy it straight away. A backend application for farmers to be able to update the produce that they sell as well as a signup page for farmers with validation in place to ensure there will be no empty data values within the database.

### How to Install
##### For Buyers
To view the web application if you are seller in action click here [!FreshVeg](https://afternoon-waters-14450.herokuapp.com/)

##### For Farmers:
    To use our CLI application please download the following programs using their application
    * A text editor program such as Visual Studio Code
    * NPM Packages/NODE.js
    * Git Bash

    Once the above is succesfully installed the next step will be to install the following npm packages:
    * colors
    * console.table
    * Inquirer
    * mysql
    * mysql 2
    * sequlize
    
    Once the above is done the next step will be to type node nodeapp.js to run the program.  This is just a loose detailing of what is required.  For full details and explanation please contact us to use the program or double check the nodeapp.js readme file which should be uploaded under the instructions file.  If not then we are still working on the detailing an easy to understand guide of the program's use.

### Instructions
Simply click on the desired produce you wish to see which then leads you to a range of farmers which sell the produce and select the produce you wish to buy and the amount will display.  Unfortunately to a limited time scope our team was unable to add in anymore than this.  It was planned in upcoming features to turn it into a webstore like thing.  

### Usage
The nodeapp.js program can only be run from the CLI.  With limited data manipulation.  More options will be updated as required or requested.  

Our web application is still under development as this was a project for a university course, it is interactable and if you wish you may add your name to the list of farmers,  You are unable to order any produce and is not an online store.
